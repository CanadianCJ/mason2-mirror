\# Athena – Owner Manual



\_Last updated: (update this line when we change things)\_



\## What Athena is



Athena is the \*\*window into Mason\*\*.



Think of it like this:



\- Mason = the brain running on your PC.

\- Athena = the control panel / UI that lets you:

&nbsp; - See status,

&nbsp; - Read reports,

&nbsp; - Send requests,

&nbsp; - (Later) approve or deny higher-risk changes.



Athena does \*\*not\*\* do the work itself; it shows you what Mason is doing and lets you talk to him.



---



\## Where Athena lives (for now)



Right now, Athena is mainly:



\- Your chat / command interface with Mason (through the tools and reports in `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2`).

\- Any future UI (web app / desktop window) that:

&nbsp; - Shows Mason health,

&nbsp; - Lists tasks,

&nbsp; - Shows Onyx/PC status,

&nbsp; - Lets you approve or deny actions.



As the project grows, we’ll plug more of Mason’s features into Athena (dashboards, buttons, alerts).

\## How Athena talks to Mason



Athena’s job is to:



1\. Let you send \*\*simple, human\*\* commands like:

&nbsp;  - “Mason, give me a status summary and next steps.”

&nbsp;  - “Show me Onyx errors.”

&nbsp;  - “Are you applying updates to yourself right now?”



2\. Feed those requests into Mason using:

&nbsp;  - Scripts and tools in:

&nbsp;    - `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\tools`

&nbsp;  - Context files in:

&nbsp;    - `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\reports`

&nbsp;    - `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\policies`

&nbsp;    - `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\tasks`



3\. Show you:

&nbsp;  - Status reports (JSON rendered as human-readable views),

&nbsp;  - Task lists (what Mason wants to do),

&nbsp;  - Alerts (if something is unhealthy).



Athena is basically the \*\*UI layer\*\* on top of Mason’s brain and tools.

\## Key Mason reports Athena can show



Important files for Athena to surface:



\- `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\reports\\mason\_self\_state.json`  

&nbsp; Snapshot of:

&nbsp; - Auto-applied tasks,

&nbsp; - Onyx health opinion,

&nbsp; - PC RAM/high-RAM info.



\- `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\reports\\mason\_brain\_context.json`  

&nbsp; Rich “brain context” (self-state + recent tasks + autonomy policy).



\- `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\reports\\mason\_selfreview\_\*.json`  

&nbsp; Daily self-review reports (generated by `Mason\_SelfReview\_Report.ps1` on a schedule).



\- `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\reports\\mason\_diskguard\_report.json`  

&nbsp; Disk guard status for C: drive.



\- `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\reports\\mason\_forensics\_inventory.json`  

&nbsp; What log/junk Mason has found.



\- `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2\\reports\\mason\_forensics\_cleanup\_summary.json`  

&nbsp; What Mason actually cleaned.



Athena should eventually have \*\*views\*\* for these (tables, graphs, traffic-light health indicators).

\## How you will use Athena day-to-day



The long-term goal is:



\- You open Athena (app / window).

\- You see:

&nbsp; - Mason health: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌

&nbsp; - Onyx health: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌

&nbsp; - PC health: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌

&nbsp; - Money loop: OFF (until you decide otherwise).

\- You can:

&nbsp; - Ask questions in plain language,

&nbsp; - Approve or deny higher-risk actions,

&nbsp; - Review what Mason changed overnight.



Right now, we are still wiring all of this up, but this manual explains the \*\*role\*\* Athena plays.

\## Athena and risk levels



Athena is where you will eventually:



\- See \*\*risk-level summaries\*\* for:

&nbsp; - PC

&nbsp; - Mason

&nbsp; - Onyx

&nbsp; - Athena itself

&nbsp; - Money

\- Approve jumps in autonomy, for example:

&nbsp; - “Allow Mason to move from level 1 → level 2 for Onyx performance.”

&nbsp; - “Turn on money loop for this one founder account (with a PIN).”



So Athena is the \*\*governor console\*\*:

\- You stay in control.

\- Mason handles the work.

\- Onyx is the product/face for clients.

\## If Athena ever feels “off”



If UI or status looks confusing or frozen:



1\. Remember: Mason is still just scripts + reports under:

&nbsp;  - `C:\\Users\\Chris\\Desktop\\Mason2`



2\. You can always:

&nbsp;  - Check reports directly in that folder,

&nbsp;  - Use PowerShell to run health tools by hand (see Mason\_MANUAL.md and PC\_MANUAL.md),

&nbsp;  - Restart any Athena UI without touching Mason’s core files.



Athena is allowed to change and improve visually.  

Mason’s safety and your control come first.
