# Athena Component Scope

## Focus
1. Operator console workflows.
2. Approval flows and decision controls.
3. Notifications and alert clarity.
4. Trust meter visibility and status transparency.

## Allowed Work
1. Changes that improve operator control, approval accuracy, or observability.
2. Improvements to trust meter surfacing, interpretation, or auditability.
3. Notification reliability and signal-to-noise tuning for operators.

## Not Allowed
1. Feature creep unrelated to operations, approvals, or observability.
2. Generic UI redesigns without measurable operator benefit.
3. Unscoped platform work that does not improve Athena operator outcomes.

## Acceptance Rules
1. State the operator-facing objective before implementation.
2. Include deterministic checks for approval/notification/trust-meter behavior.
3. Keep changes minimal and traceable to the stated Athena objective.
